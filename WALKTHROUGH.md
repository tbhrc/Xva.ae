## Changes
1. **Branding Update**:
   - Replaced all instances of "ImplementAI" and "ImplementAI.ae" with "**iMPLEMENTAi.ae**" in visible text and meta tags.
   - Preserved lowercase URLs and social handles to ensure links remain functional.

2. **Documentation**:
   - Created `README.md` with strict branding rules and development process guidelines.
   - The process now requires:
     - Task List for every change.
     - Walkthrough upon completion.
     - Version Control entry.

3. **Version Control**:
   - Initialized `version-control` file starting at Version 7.0.
   - Implemented the separator format `____________________`.

## Verification
- Checked `index.html` and other key pages to ensure the company name is displayed correctly as "iMPLEMENTAi.ae".
- Verified that external links (LinkedIn, Twitter) and internal URLs still use the correct lowercase format where necessary.

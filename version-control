Goal
The goal was to resolve CACHE_BUST redeclaration lint errors and canonical URL inconsistencies across all identified HTML files, remove duplicated HTML content, ensure consistent branding (iMPLEMENTAi.ae), and implement a consistent 4-column sitemap footer.

2. Domain and Canonical URL Updates
All canonical URLs were updated to use https://www.implementai.ae/.
All internal links were verified to use www or relative paths.
CACHE_BUST script (const CACHE_BUST = '20251202.v2.0';) was added to the <head> of all files to ensure proper caching.
3. Footer Expansion
The footer was updated across all pages to a consistent 4-column sitemap layout.
Footer columns:
iMPLEMENTAi.ae: Description and social links.
Services: Links to Strategy, Automation, Workshops, Fractional CAIO, AI Readiness.

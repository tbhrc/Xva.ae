HTML Duplication Cleanup and Domain/Footer Updates
Goal
The goal was to resolve CACHE_BUST redeclaration lint errors and canonical URL inconsistencies across all identified HTML files, remove duplicated HTML content, ensure consistent branding (iMPLEMENTAi.ae), and implement a consistent 4-column sitemap footer.

Changes
1. HTML Duplication Cleanup
Duplicated HTML content (nested <html> structures) was removed from the following files. Unique content was preserved and integrated into the main structure.

about.html
departments.html
fractional-caio.html
workshops.html
terms.html
team.html
privacy.html
solutions-hr.html
solutions-finance.html
solutions-ops.html
solutions-sales.html
strategy.html
resources.html
contact.html
2. Domain and Canonical URL Updates
All canonical URLs were updated to use https://www.implementai.ae/.
All internal links were verified to use www or relative paths.
CACHE_BUST script (const CACHE_BUST = '20251202.v2.0';) was added to the <head> of all files to ensure proper caching.
3. Footer Expansion
The footer was updated across all pages to a consistent 4-column sitemap layout.
Footer columns:
iMPLEMENTAi.ae: Description and social links.
Services: Links to Strategy, Automation, Workshops, Fractional CAIO, AI Readiness.
Solutions: Links to Solutions Hub, HR, Finance, Operations, Sales.
Company: Links to About, Team, Resources, Contact, Privacy, Terms.
Copyright text updated to 2025 iMPLEMENTAi.ae.

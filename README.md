# iMPLEMENTAi.ae

## Branding Rules
- **Company Name**: The company is ALWAYS spelled **iMPLEMENTAi.ae**.
- **Forbidden Spellings**: Do NOT use "ImplementAI", "Implement AI", or any other variation.
- **Domain**: `https://implementai.ae` is the primary domain. `www.implementai.ae` also works.

## Development Process
1. **Task List**: For all website edits and changes, a Task List must be created first.
2. **Walkthrough**: Once work is completed, a walkthrough must be provided.
3. **Version Control**: All updates must be logged in the `version-control.md` file.
   - Each new improvement or change is separated by a long line: `____________________`
   - Versioning starts from **Version 7.0** and increments by **0.1** for each change.
   - The Task List should be added to the version entry to clearly mention what was changed and implemented.

# Implement AI Website Update  
### Key Points and Objectives (Version 7.2)

## Version Control
- A full project backup has been created.
- Current working version: **7.2**.
- GitHub version control lacks detail, so a **manual version control document** is being used.
- For every update:
  - Copy all edits into the version control doc.
  - Add a long line of underscores as a separator.
  - Label the new section with the next version number (e.g., **7.3**).
  - List changes clearly.

## Website Direction
- Current site looks too "techy" and more aligned with AI agents.
- Needs a **complete redesign** focused on:
  - Professionalism
  - Corporate credibility
  - C level expectations
  - Consultancy-first approach
- The new direction should resemble:
  - McKinsey
  - Bain
  - KPMG
  - Top 5 AI consultancy websites from Google

## Brand Positioning
